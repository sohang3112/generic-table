# table-layout
This is an older program made by me, in which I had focussed on developing <br />
a nice table-layout, including boundaries and resizable columns.

## TODO
- Improve word wrapping so that a cell doesn't wrap in the middle of a word.
- Calculate the columns widths for each column, given a restriction (such as fixing maximum <br />
  table width, eg. when printing on console). Goal is to minimize the table height, i.e., <br />
  the sum of all the row heights.
